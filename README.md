Learning about git and >:D
# First Step

This is the first change i'll be doing in git commands using git add to stage the content
Afterwards i'll be using commit to change it back to unmodified
And using DIFF, i can check upon changes that have been done upon the older version of it
Or if you're using VSC like me, you can check directly upon the UI the changes that have been made in the code

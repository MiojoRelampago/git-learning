Learning about git and >:D
# First Step

This is the first change i'll be doing in git commands using git add to stage the content
Afterwards i'll be using commit to change it back to unmodified
And using DIFF, i can check upon changes that have been done upon the older version of it
Or if you're using VSC like me, you can check directly upon the UI the changes that have been made in the code

# Using LOG and RESTORE

Using the command LOG, you can get some info on the previous launches that were done into this files and it's hashes
Hashes are the way that git/github can turn back to previous versions of a code that were changed

Restore whatsoever, rests on "Restoring" to the previous changes, not exactly a previous version, but if you made new changes into your git, you can turn back with RESTORE
This can be done on modified state or staged state, if you made a -add but changed your mind midway of the process, you remove it from the staged state or modified if used again
